Binary Tree LCA

Have the function BinaryTreeLCA(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain 3 elements: the first element will be a binary tree with all unique values in a format similar to how a binary heap is implemented with NULL nodes at any level represented with a #, the second and third elements will be two different values, and your goal is to find the lowest common ancestor of these two values.



For example: if strArr is ["[12, 5, 9, 6, 2, 0, 8, #, #, 7, 4, #, #, #, #]", "6", "4"] then this tree looks like the following:
